# What I've done since finishing this section of the class

- Well, the video is based on their 2017 class so I already had to modify player input based on what I learned in earlier sections of the class (which were done on Unity 2018)
- Had to also do a few mods based on how prefabs are now handled.

# What I learned in this module of the class

- Using Unity Tilemap to create levels
- Using rule tiles to make painting a level happen somewhat automatically and be less of a PITA
- If you load more levels into hierarchy, you can see multiple scenes at once to visualize level flow
- Gating technique - for example, make the cliff so large the player can't jump back up and get back to the beginning
